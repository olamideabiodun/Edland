advanced learning management system that replaces traditional skill tracking with real-world skill verification. Every skill you learn generates a lifelong data asset that you own entirely.

Make these into cards (check feature section on usepdfx.com)

Verified Skill Identity
Every assignment you complete, every project you lead, every endorsement you receive becomes real, verifiable proof. Employers see evidence, not empty claims. When your lecturer endorses you, Ednux records it with institutional authentication. No one can fake this.

Living Portfolio Builder
Your portfolio grows automatically as you learn. Class projects, presentations, club activities, certifications, all timestamped and verified. By graduation, you have a complete talent graph showing exactly what you've done and who you've become.

Organized Learning Spaces
All your lectures, files, teams, chats, tasks, and feedback live in one structured hub. No more scattered WhatsApp groups where information goes to die. Everything is organized by course, team, or project, and everything contributes to your growing career proof.

Student Identity Layer
Ednux becomes your living digital profile that grows from Year 1 to graduation and beyond. Unlike one page CVs that barely capture your real capabilities, Ednux documents your entire journey.

Collaborative Learning Tools
Create study groups, share resources, work on team projects, and learn together. When you lead a group project, Ednux records leadership skill. When you solve problems together, Ednux tracks collaboration. Every interaction builds your verified record.

Employer Discovery
Companies can search for students by verified skills, projects, and competencies. You become visible to opportunities before graduation, not years after. We connect schools, students, and recruiters in one ecosystem.

Real Time Skill Tracking
Learn Excel, Python, writing, or any skill, and watch your competency graph update with real abilities, not self reported claims. See exactly which skills you're developing and how you compare to industry standards.

Career Timeline
Your entire academic and extracurricular journey displayed as a visual, verified, tamper proof timeline. Every course completed, every skill gained, every leadership role, all in one undeniable record that grows with you forever.
